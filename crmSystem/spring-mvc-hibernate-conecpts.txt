@repository extends @componet:
It is used for dap based classes only
It allows componet scan for dao classes
- > It also helps in exception handling: it also hanldes jbdc exceptions that are checked 
							and converts them inot unchked exception and hence try catch is not needed

@repository works only when DAO pattern is implemented
we should take autorwiing based on qualifier and interface reference only
