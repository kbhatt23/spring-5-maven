@repository extends @componet:
It is used for dap based classes only
It allows componet scan for dao classes
- > It also helps in exception handling: it also hanldes jbdc exceptions that are checked 
							and converts them inot unchked exception and hence try catch is not needed

@repository works only when DAO pattern is implemented
we should take autorwiing based on qualifier and interface reference only

it is always advisable to keep service layer sperate form DAO layer.
This helps in future when more business logic is needed.
We can add business logic on service layer instead of dao layer.
This introduces single responsibility priniciple and hence adds reusability of code.

Also it is better to keep transactions in service layer and remove that from dao.
Meaning dao class shud use transaction from service layer context. 

The spring mvc model attribute gets completely overriden by form submission data.
So in case we are setting something in presenter get mapping to model attribute
and then the fields that are not present in form gets removed to default java values.

This can be manged by setting hidden field path for property .
On load path calls getter function and on form submit it calls setter function to model attribute
