Bcrypt algo is one way exncryption
It do not require decryption
We can store bcryupted passwords in DB using below syntaxt
{bcrypt}hashedpassword-----
instead of
{noop}Suyarez@23

The size of bcrypt key is always 60 so we need to increase the size
to 68 {bcrypt} size is 8 and 60 for hashed password

Steps in validation
a. Passwords are stored using Bcrypted key
b. User enters normal password
c. Spring takes normal password entered and encrypt it(as bcrypt can not be decrypted)
d . encrypted above is compared with already stoed encrupted password in DB
