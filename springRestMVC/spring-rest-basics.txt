Jackosn needs no arg constructor to initialize , it do not uses arg constructor
jackson uses setter while createing bean from json and use getters while converting bean to json

Exceptin handling is not auto configured in spring
which means we have to add sample error response bean dn exception handler for this.

In spring boot autoconfiguration provides a default sample error repsonse for every runtime exception thrown in code where
call is initiated by controller

@exceptionhanlder is situated on the restcontrller where exception is thrown
@exceptionhanlder do not work outside in a new class
we cna make it global by creating a new class with annotation @contoleradvice
We can make a global class with anotaion @controlleradvice and handle all kind of exceptions in one class:	
				- following single repsoisiblity principle


Spring boot provide default exception hadnling and showing default error response and status code for all exceptions

But we can customize it using the above steps,
Spring basic do not provide such handling and we need to create all classes our own
In exception handler annotation it can be used locally by controller and other controllers can not use it
we can create controlelradvice class and add excpetionhandler functions for glocal access to all controllers

With help of conmtroller advice we can trhow exceptions from multiple controller sand still handles that and send proper response to client				

In spring we should use the url as the name of resource in plural and should not add verbs or actions in the url
Instead actions are defined using the httpmethod
Resource name or entity name should the the url in plural
