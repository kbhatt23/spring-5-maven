Spring boot auto configures beans needed for jap and hibernate :
for example data source , localSessionfactoryBean or LocalEntityManagerBean if we add spring data pa

All auto config depends on depenncies.
JPA is just specification like interfaces , actual implementation needs a vendor like hibernate or eclipse link etc.
Defaullt is hibernate for spring boot.

Spring boot configures beans of type loclaentitymanagerfactorybean class and data soruce.
the properties can be configured in application.proeprties

benefits of jpa:
it will make coding flexible ,  we can change vendor anytime with very less coding

comparison between data jpa and hibernate

hibernate											data jpa
sessionfactory								persistence Context
session										entitymanager
session.save                                 entitymnanager.persiste
session.saveOrupdate                          entitymnanager.persist
session.delete								entitymnanager.remove
session.get										entitymnanager.find

benefits of sprnig data jpa Repostiory :
removes boiler plate code
provide transactions so no need to manually add transaction until there is need

Spring data rest:
This project reduces need of controller
We just need to define entity and jparepostiroy interface, and all the endpoints will get exposed
Name of endpoint will be entity name -> with first characters in lowercase and ends with "s" character.
EG : Employee entity becomes employees
spring data rest picks all classes with @repository than extends JPARepository and takes enities
 from it and exposes endpoints
 
 sorting url :
 http://localhost:8081/magic-api/employees?sort=employeeFirstName,desc
 
 we can choose page and size in the url:
 //starts with 0
 http://localhost:8081/magic-api/employees?page=0&size=3
